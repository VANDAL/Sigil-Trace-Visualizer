# Sigil-Trace-Visualizer
Dot-based visualization tool for Sigil Traces

## About
This is an experimental visualization tool for text-based workload traces generated by
[Prism](https://github.com/vandal/prism)'s [SynchroTrace](http://vandal-prism.readthedocs.io/en/docs/backends.html#synchrotracegen) tool.

The traces are called *Sigil* traces for historical reasons.
